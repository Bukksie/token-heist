## Game Rules

- Two players compete on a 3x3 board, one as the police and the other as the thief. They take turns to move, with the thief starting first.
- The police have five cops to deploy, whose positions are public and fixed. Their objective is to position them where they think the thief might be.
- After the police deployment, they can learn if the thief is adjacent. Then it's the thief's turn to move.
- The thief can move secretly or stay put but cannot move to a cell occupied by a cop. If the thief wins, they gain tokens corresponding to the sum of the number of cells in their path.
- If a cop is placed on the cell occupied by the thief, the game ends, and the police win.
- If all five cops are deployed without catching the thief, the game ends, and the thief wins.
